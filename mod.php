                                 <p class="m_bottom_10">In most FPS games, your first trigger pull is the most accurate, then goes down considerably, a Rapid Fire Controller will give you an extreme amount of accuracy percentage, since every shot is a first shot and many per second, giving you a trememdous advantage.</p>

                                 <p class="m_bottom_10">This allows you to use two weapons at the same time, one for each arm! You can use two identical or different weapons. This enables new fighting techniques. You could  be ready for both short and long distance encounters, but you will use two separate “fire” keys for the two weapons.</p>

                                 <p class="m_bottom_10">Increase your accuracy severely with this mod. It allows you to automatically hold breath while aiming, to avoid movement. You will spend less time trying to locate opponents and trying to hold your aim steady. In most FPS games your breath is limited while aiming, but not with feature added to your controller.</p>

                                 <p class="m_bottom_10">This enables you to move through maps/levels more quickly, by allowing you to constantly run rather than walk. It also makes it harder for opponents to lock on and aim at you, enabling you to avoid damage. Most of the time your running time is limited, but this makes it infinite.</p>

                                 <p class="m_bottom_10">The auto spotting mod is only compatible with Battlefield 3 & 4 at this time. It enables you to spot your opponents throughout your matches with zero effort. Giving you a great advantage in team matches.</p>

These buttons can be re-mapped to the user’s liking at any time, to the following stock buttons: LT, LB, RT, RB, X, Y, B, A, back button, left thumbstick press, or right thumbstick press.</p>

                                 <p class="m_bottom_10">Quick scoping is used in Call of Duty games. The idea with a quick scope is to use a sniper rifle, scope in, and fire the shot just as the gun scopes in. Get the timing and the aiming down just perfectly, and you can become a one-shot kill perfectionist.</p>

                                 <p class="m_bottom_10">Turn any semi-automatic into a Burst weapon. Just quickly pull R and release it. You can change speed and type of the Burst mode to make a different round bursts for multiple weapons. Helps create better accuracy and can also through off opponents who will be expecting you to at a normal rate, rather than a burst fire.</p>

                                 <p class="m_bottom_10">The Jitter mod fires 3 burst weapons, bolt action and shotguns like if they’re fully automatic. This mod really comes in handy and is a game changer. Catch your opponent off guard with this awesome modification.</p>

                                 <p class="m_bottom_10">Fast Reload is most effective on Modern Warfare, Modern Warfare 2, Black Ops 2 and even the latest Ghosts. It is not as effective on Black Ops, because it is using a different graphics engine that is not as susceptible to the Fast Reload glitch.</p>
